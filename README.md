Hello! My name is Kara Grassau and I am an engineering intern this summer at a risk management and classification firm.
In my position, I am required to review designs and confirm that they are safe and in compliance with industry standards. Thus, I decided to create a tool that other engineers could use to make this process simple and easily accessible. 

Currently, the tool is capable of...

ASME BPVC VIII-1 App.2 design verification.
   - SI/Metric units
   - Customary/Imperial Units

Next, I plan to add a tool for API 6A specifications.

I am fairly new to programming, so if you notice anything that can be improved, please let me know!

Thanks,
Kara
